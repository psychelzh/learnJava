# Learn `Java` and algorithm

I am now devoted to become a coder since 2018-05, which I know the most basic thing is to learn algorithms and data structure. Then I began to use [the book](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) written by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, accompanied by its [coursera lectures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1). So much appreciation to them!

Here I store all the codes used to do the exercises in the book. Hopefully it will be a good record of my learning trace.
